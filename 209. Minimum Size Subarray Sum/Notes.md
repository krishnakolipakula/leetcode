## Sliding Window Technique for Minimal Subarray Length

### Problem Statement
The **Sliding Window Technique** is employed to efficiently solve the problem of finding the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to a given target. If no such subarray exists, the output is `0`. This approach achieves an \( O(n) \) time complexity by dynamically adjusting a window over the array.

---

### Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - A variable `min_len` is initialized to infinity (`float("inf")`) to store the minimum subarray length.
   - Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are used to represent the window boundaries.
   - A `sum_curr` variable is used to track the sum of elements within the window.

2. **Expanding the Window:**
   - The `right` pointer iterates through the array, expanding the window by adding the value at `nums[right]` to `sum_curr`.

3. **Shrinking the Window:**
   - While `sum_curr` is greater than or equal to the target, calculate the current window size (`right - left + 1`) and update `min_len` if itâ€™s smaller.
   - Shrink the window by subtracting the value at `nums[left]` and moving the `left` pointer to the right.

4. **Return Result:**
   - If no valid subarray is found (i.e., `min_len` is still infinity), return `0`.
   - Otherwise, return `min_len`.

### Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize variables
        min_len = float("inf")  # Tracks the minimal length of valid subarray
        left = 0  # Start of the sliding window
        sum_curr = 0  # Current sum of elements in the sliding window
        
        # Iterate over the array with the right pointer
        for right in range(len(nums)):
            sum_curr += nums[right]  # Expand the window by adding the current element
            
            # While the window sum meets or exceeds the target
            while sum_curr >= target:
                # Update the minimal length of the subarray
                min_len = min(min_len, right - left + 1)
                # Shrink the window from the left
                sum_curr -= nums[left]
                left += 1
        
        # Return the minimal length if found, otherwise 0
        return min_len if min_len != float("inf") else 0
