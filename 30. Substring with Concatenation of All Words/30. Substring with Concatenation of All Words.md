# Concatenated Substrings of Words in a String

## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings in `words` are of the same length.

A **concatenated string** is a string that exactly contains all the strings of any permutation of `words` concatenated.

For example, if `words = ["ab", "cd", "ef"]`, then the following strings are valid concatenated strings:
- `"abcdef"`, 
- `"abefcd"`, 
- `"cdabef"`, 
- `"cdefab"`, 
- `"efabcd"`, 
- `"efcdab"`

However, `"acdbef"` is not a valid concatenated string because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of the words in `words`.

### Task

Return an array of the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in `s`. You can return the answer in **any order**.

### Examples

#### Example 1:

**Input:**

```
s = "barfoothefoobarman"
words = ["foo", "bar"]
Example 1:

Input: s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]

Output: [0,9]

Explanation:

The substring starting at 0 is "barfoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","foo"] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is "foobar". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar"] which is a permutation of words.

Example 2:

Input: s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"]

Output: []

Explanation:

There is no concatenated substring.

Example 3:

Input: s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarman", words = ["bar","foo","the"]

Output: [6,9,12]

Explanation:

The substring starting at 6 is "foobarthe". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar","the"].
The substring starting at 9 is "barthefoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","the","foo"].
The substring starting at 12 is "thefoobar". It is the concatenation of ["the","foo","bar"].
```
